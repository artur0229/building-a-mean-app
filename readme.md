# Building a MEAN App
<br>

---

## Learning Objectives

- Identify how different components of a MEAN app work together
- Build a simple Express app with data persistence, and dynamic views  
- Provide an example of a MEAN app
- Place tools and technologies into big picture
- Explain when to choose the MEAN stack

## How We Got Here
<br>

### Why Express?
<br>

### Why Mongo?
<br>

 We've learned a considerable amount of information about relational databases. We join on foreign keys in relational databases in order to query our database. Sometimes these joins can get really expensive to query the database.

When dealing with less complex associations, non relational databases can be more effective. Mongo provides a more flexible, scalable solution for less complex domain models.

MongoDB is an open-source **document database** that provides:
- High Performance
- High Availability
- Automatic Scaling

### Why Mongoose?
<br>

Like ActiveRecord for Rails, Mongoose is an ORM we can use to represent data from a Mongo database as models in a Javascript back-end.

## How We’ll Get There

Today we are going to walkthrough adding Angular to a MEN app, by turning our app [whenpresident](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/whenpresident) into a SPA.
