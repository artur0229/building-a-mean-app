- Identify how different components of a MEAN app work together
- Build a simple Express app with data persitence, and dynamic views  
- Provide an example of a MEAN app
- Place tools and technologies into big picture
- Defend why to choose the MEAN stack

### Why Express?

### Why Mongo?

Well, we've come full circle ... again. What we're learning today isn't
fundamentally that different from what we know. We're going to learn a
different way to store information. A document-based non-relational way. We've
learned a considerable amount of information about relational databases.
We join on foreign keys in relational databases in order to query our database
. Sometimes these joins can get really expensive to query the database. When
dealing with less complex associations, non relational databases can be more
effective. We've also seen that schema's in SQL(relational DB's) are fairly
rigid. Adding columns can be taxing(migrations). Also if we delete a row in a
table that is being used as a foreign key in another table, we must delete
all the rows associated with that foreign key before we can delete the parent
object. Mongo provides a more flexible, scalable solution for less complex
domain models.

> This is not to say that mongo is a better solution than postgres or other
SQL libraries, but an alternative solution.


MongoDB is an open-source **document database** that provides:
- High Performance
- High Availability
- Automatic Scaling
